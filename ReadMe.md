## What I have learnt while making this project?

> This project was a bit challenging, as it helped me learn a lot about CSS properties related to HTML Lists. I also got better with using all kinds of basic CSS properties, especially the vertical alignment of Child DIV elements inside a container and use of margin & padding while working with big images & Div at the same time.
